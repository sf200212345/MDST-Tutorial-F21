Hi! My name is Steve Fan, and I'm currently a sophomore about to declare for the CS-LSA major. A fun fact about myself is that I was actually very resistant towards CS and programming until the summer I came to college, when I actually tried out a programming course and ended up liking it. I'm excited to meet new people and learn more about data science in this club!
